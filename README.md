## Random thoughts
- an agent is just some code building up a long prompt using some format like "use the following format to tell me which tool you want: [TOOL_REQUEST]:[TOOL_NAME] or similar"
- multiagent system just means one agent can use other agents as tools, with some orchestration agent
- agents could generate their own tools and run in a sandbox

- agent reasoning patterns
 - reflection "reflect on the output you justgave"
 - tool use
 - planning "plan steps, think more slowly, explain your reasoning step by step, forces to think through"
 - multi agent
